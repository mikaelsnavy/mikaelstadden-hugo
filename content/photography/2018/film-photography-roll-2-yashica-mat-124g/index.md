Hot off my first roll of film, my next one was my first roll through my new to me medium format camera, a Yashica Mat 124G! The Yashica is a great budget camera that I picked up off a film group on Facebook. It needed minimal work (new light meter battery & calibration as well as cleaning of oil off the shutter blades) and was quickly ready to use. Thanks [Blue Moon Camera](https://www.bluemooncamera.com/){:target=\"_blank\"} for the repairs.

I choose the Yashica because I was drawn to TLR medium format cameras. Maybe it's the lovely texture of medium format film combined with the beauty of a TLR camera. Yashica cameras are pretty easy to find now and are a great deal. You can pick up a decent condition one for around $100 if you're patient and get wonderful photos for the price.

I started this roll on a weekend beach trip on February 16th – 18th 2018 and finished the roll [during my surprise proposal in Guatemala](https://www.mgpulido.co/surprise-proposal-guatemala-jungle-semuc-champey/){:target=\"_blank\"}. I did quickly find TLRs to be disorientating and difficult to frame due to the shifted perspective but caught on.

The first things I noticed when I got this roll back is the vertical lines through ALL the photos. Was it a mistake loading the film? Was it due due to going through an X-ray machine about 5 times on the way to Guatemala? I'm still not sure but the effect is obvious.

My friends, Kyle and Jamie recently got engaged so they got the A-list treatment this weekend (including photography from 4 cameras).

SUPER blurry from playing around indoors. It took me a while to get used to the focusing mechanism.

Here is the first photo from Guatemala from the [Utopia Eco Hotel ](https://www.utopiaecohotel.com/)near Lanquin. The common eating / bar / hangout area was a HUGE balcony looking directly into the canopy. Photos taken on February 26th – 28th, 2018.

Trouble in paradise – I got lazy with focusing. With all the autofocusing and smartphone technology I have experienced in my life, I DEFINITELY did not take proper care.

Next, we moved to Antigua, Guatemala. Photos taken February 25th and 26th, 2018. I was obviously struggling with focusing more but still had some fun with the cityscapes at night.
