My third film roll was roll #2 with my Yashica Mat 124G. I shot this entire roll on March 1st, 2018 (yes in one day) after my previous rolls lasting weeks. I'll be honest, I was feeling pretty cocky. Maybe it was [my propal that went off the rails which I magically recovered](https://www.mgpulido.co/surprise-proposal-guatemala-jungle-semuc-champey/){:target=\"_blank\"}. Maybe it was the allure of working with a film camera and thinking I was cool. Whatever it was, I didn't take the proper time to setup my shots. A lot of them are out of focus, blurry, underexposed, and just hurried.

I am ultimatelyÂ  disappointed with this roll but it was still a great learning experience. This roll in a magical and memorable place that was underwhelming will remind me to take my time in the future.

Testing out the timer!

Churches in Central America are not this blurry generally.Â ðŸ˜‚

This would have been SO perfect if I lined it up beter and focused correctly. Cars were distracting us in the street.

Getting dark and blurry â€“ I blame it on the alcohol.

Last shot was a timer shot on a rooftop brew pub just before we went home. Timer works, shot is just underexposed by about 6 clicks.
